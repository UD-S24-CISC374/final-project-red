Bash the Dungeon is a top-down adventure game where players explore a dungeon and learn bash commands as they meet friendly dungeon dwellers and defeat enemeies. With each enemy encounter, players put their bash skills to the test as they strategically use their 'spells.' Players utilize an in-game terminal to enter bash commands and navigate filesystems.

# Basic Instructions
